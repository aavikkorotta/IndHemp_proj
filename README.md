INDHEM
ROTH C MODELLING

Baseline scenario: crop rotations without hemp --> canola/barley/winter wheat

Project scenario: crop rotations with hemp every 3 or 4 years --> hemp/barley/spring wheat/winter wheat/canola/chickpeas

Project start date:	May to July 2024

Initial project area:	192.82 ha


Spin-up period: 500 years, utilized the average climate data from January 2001 to December 2019. 

Warm-up period: 5 years, utilized the average climate data from January 2020 to December 2024. 

Foward run for projections: 40 years, from 2024 to 2064.


Soil sampling depth:	50 cm (except for 3 samples)

Mean Clay from samples:	24.95%

Sampled SOC: After outliers’ accommodation the SOC values for all samples, estimated on ESM basis, ranged from a minimum of 44.82 to a maximum of 301.84 tons C/ha. The mean SOC was 133.35 ± 69.42 (SD), based on a total of 84 samples. Note that even though this is the mean for the top 50 cm, it's still extremely high for cropland, but within the values reported in the scientific literature for grasslands.
